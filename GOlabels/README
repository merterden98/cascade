From Yuelin Liu readme:

[Notes]
- Some GO terms have altid's (alternative id), and the .obo file
  documents the altid if a GO term has one. The hierarchyModule
  constructs the ontology DAG with the main id for a GO term;
  however, GO association files contain altid's. All altid's are
  first translate into its corresponding main id's before being
  propagated up the ontology.
- At the end of each association file, there might be one line 
  containing all genes without any GO term label.
  Those gene names are not included in the final output file.
- Not all labeled genes participate in all subcomponents of the
  Gene Ontology. Genes that do not have GO labels in a subcomponent
  are excluded from the output file for that subcomponent.
- The tab-separated files have the following format:

  [Gene_1] [GO term]@[GO level] ... [GO term]@[GOlevel]
  ...
  ...
  ...
  [Gene_x] [GO term]@[GO level] ... [GO term]@[GOlevel]

- GO terms for each gene are sorted by GO levels (shortest path
  distance to the root node of the subcomponent) in increasing
  order
